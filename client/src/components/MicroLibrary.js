        Hi 🙂 I would like to test on idea 🙂 I have got about 30 books that I don’t want to sell but as well I don’t mind if my customers use it. That’s why I decided to put in on rent. It is completely free of charge.

    The rent is for 1 month. You are oblidged to give back the book before 1 month pass unless we agreed otherwise.
    1 customer can rent only 1 book at the time
     Before renting a book you need to give us the following details: your first name and your phone number.
    We will use those details only in order  to remaind you about the books that should be  given back. (more about Privacy Policy)
    Only books from the shelf “Microlibrary” are for rent. (about 30 books)
    Please feel free to ask if the book is available either by phone on email.
    If the books will be not given back to frequently it will result in suspending the project.
